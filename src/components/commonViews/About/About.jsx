          Corruption is a huge bane to Africaâ€™s development. African countries
          must develop novel and localised solutions that will curb this menace,
          hence the birth of iReporter. iReporter enables any/every citizen to
          bring any form of corruption to the notice of appropriate authorities
          and the general public. You can also report on things that needs
          government intervention.
        </p>
        <br />
        <p>
          iReporter has several features that enables you to give concrete
          information on your reports. These features are video and picture
          uploads, geo-location of the occurence accompanied with a breif story
          or write-up.
